## Self-hosting when?

### I will not help you set up self-hosting, do not message me asking.

Requirements:

- Node.js 10.x or 12.x
- MySQL or MariaDB
- Redis (tested on Windows using Memurai)

Create a .env file with your secrets (you can refer to the .env.example for what is needed).

Install dependencies:
```javascript
npm install
```
Run:
```
npm start
```

Custom icons will not show for you, you can change those in `icons.json`.

## Contributing


Feel free to contribute! Check the issues tab to see what needs to be worked on. If you're planning on fixing a bug, make sure an issue was created first so I can verify that the bug exists.

You can run:
```
npm run test
```
to make sure your code follows the project style and passes the tests
