## Contributing


Feel free to contribute! Check the issues tab to see what needs to be worked on. If you're planning on fixing a bug, make sure an issue was created first so I can verify that the bug exists.

You can run:
```
npm run test
```
to make sure your code follows the project style and passes the tests

the item files can be found at src/resources/items and also src/resources/json

if you want to contribute an item please add it to the file, make sure you give it an icon, then make a pull request for it,

making an icon

1. create a discord server
2. add jeremy to it
3. add the icon you want as an emoji
4. get its id (google "how to get a discord emoji id")
5. add it to the file in the "icon": part of the item, also add the full image into the "image": part of it as well
6. then create a pull request with your edited item file
